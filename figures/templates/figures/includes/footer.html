            BlairOracle is a project by seniors at Montgomery Blair High School in
            Silver Spring, Maryland. It was created during the Fall 2018 Political Statistics course
            taught by Mr. David Stein. Questions for the students about the model can
            be sent to mbhs.polistat@gmail.com, while Mr. Stein can be reached directly through
            the Blair website.
